# The Inventory Sorter

## Challenge Background

TechInnovate, a rapidly growing e-commerce startup, is facing a critical issue with their inventory management system. As the company's product catalog expands, the current sorting algorithm is proving to be inefficient, causing delays in order processing and inventory updates. You've been tasked with implementing a more efficient sorting algorithm to organize the product database.

## Your Mission

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to implement a quicksort algorithm to efficiently sort TechInnovate's product database. This will significantly improve the performance of their inventory system, allowing for faster searches, updates, and order fulfillment.

## Objectives

1. Implement a quicksort algorithm in your preferred programming language.
2. Ensure the algorithm can sort products based on various attributes (e.g., price, stock quantity, product ID).
3. Test the algorithm with a sample dataset of at least 1000 products.
4. Compare the performance of your quicksort implementation with the current sorting method.

## Amazon Q Developer Hints

- Use Amazon Q Developer to help you understand the quicksort algorithm if you're not familiar with it.
- Ask Amazon Q Developer for assistance in implementing the partition function, a crucial part of the quicksort algorithm.
- Use Amazon Q Developer to generate test data for your algorithm.
- Ask for help in writing performance comparison code to measure the efficiency of your implementation.

## Bonus Challenges

1. Implement a hybrid sorting algorithm that uses quicksort for large partitions and insertion sort for small partitions to optimize performance.
2. Add multi-threading capabilities to your quicksort implementation for even faster sorting of large datasets.
3. Create a simple command-line interface that allows users to choose which product attribute to sort by.

## Learning Opportunities

- Deepen your understanding of the quicksort algorithm and its average-case O(n log n) time complexity.
- Gain experience in algorithm implementation and optimization.
- Learn how to use Amazon Q Developer to assist in complex coding tasks and algorithm design.
- Practice working with large datasets and performance optimization techniques.

Remember, the goal is not just to complete the challenge, but to learn and explore the capabilities of Amazon Q Developer in VS Code. Don't hesitate to ask Amazon Q for explanations, optimizations, or alternative approaches as you work through the challenge. Good luck, developer!
