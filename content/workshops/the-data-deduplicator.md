Develop a solution to identify and remove duplicate customer records from TechInnovate's database without losing important information.

# The Data Deduplicator

## Challenge Background

As TechInnovate's customer base has grown rapidly, their database has accumulated duplicate customer records due to various data entry issues and system migrations. These duplicates are causing confusion in customer communications and skewing analytics. As a key developer, you've been tasked with creating a solution to identify and remove duplicate customer records without losing important information.

## Your Mission

Your mission is to develop a sophisticated data deduplication algorithm. This algorithm needs to identify potential duplicate records, merge them intelligently, and ensure that no critical customer information is lost in the process.

## Objectives

1. Design a data structure to represent customer records, including fields like name, email, phone number, address, and purchase history.
2. Implement a function to calculate the similarity between two customer records using various metrics (e.g., Levenshtein distance for names, fuzzy matching for addresses).
3. Create an algorithm that identifies potential duplicate records based on similarity scores.
4. Develop a merging strategy that combines information from duplicate records without data loss.
5. Build a system to apply your deduplication algorithm to a large dataset efficiently.

## Amazon Q Developer Hints

- Use Amazon Q Developer to help you understand and implement string similarity algorithms like Levenshtein distance or Jaro-Winkler distance.
- Ask for assistance in designing efficient data structures for quick comparison and lookup of customer records.
- Use Amazon Q Developer to suggest optimization techniques for processing large datasets, such as indexing or parallel processing.
- Request help in implementing fuzzy matching algorithms for comparing address fields.

## Bonus Challenges

1. Implement a machine learning model to improve duplicate detection accuracy over time.
2. Create a user interface that allows manual review and approval of potential duplicates.
3. Develop a system that can handle incremental deduplication as new records are added to the database.

## Learning Opportunities

- Gain experience in working with complex data structures and algorithms for string matching and comparison.
- Learn about data quality issues and strategies for maintaining clean databases.
- Practice optimizing algorithms for large-scale data processing.
- Explore the challenges of entity resolution and record linkage in real-world datasets.
- Understand the importance of data integrity in business operations and analytics.

Remember to leverage Amazon Q Developer throughout your development process. It can assist you with algorithm design, optimization strategies, and even help you understand complex concepts in data deduplication. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or alternative approaches as you work through this challenging data cleaning problem. Good luck, and may your deduplication algorithm bring clarity and accuracy to TechInnovate's customer database!
