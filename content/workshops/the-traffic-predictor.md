# The Traffic Predictor

## Challenge Background

TechInnovate's e-commerce platform experiences significant fluctuations in website traffic, leading to occasional performance issues during peak times. To better prepare for these high-load periods, the company wants to implement a predictive system for website traffic. As a key developer, you've been tasked with creating a machine learning model to forecast traffic patterns.

## Your Mission

Your mission is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict website traffic patterns. This model should take into account historical data, seasonal trends, and external factors to help TechInnovate prepare its infrastructure for varying levels of user activity.

## Objectives

1. Design a data structure to represent historical traffic data, including timestamps, user counts, and relevant external factors (e.g., holidays, marketing campaigns).
2. Implement a function to preprocess and clean the historical data, handling missing values and outliers.
3. Create a machine learning model (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future traffic levels.
4. Develop a method to evaluate the model's accuracy using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
5. Build a system to periodically retrain the model with new data to maintain its accuracy over time.

## Amazon Q Developer Hints

- Use Amazon Q Developer to help you understand different time series forecasting techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).
- Ask for assistance in implementing data preprocessing functions, including handling of time-based features.
- Use Amazon Q Developer to suggest appropriate machine learning libraries and frameworks for your chosen approach.
- Request help in implementing model evaluation metrics and interpreting the results.

## Bonus Challenges

1. Implement an ensemble model that combines predictions from multiple forecasting techniques.
2. Create a real-time anomaly detection system to identify unexpected traffic spikes.
3. Develop a visualization dashboard to display traffic predictions and historical trends.

## Learning Opportunities

- Gain experience in working with time series data and forecasting algorithms.
- Learn about feature engineering for time-based prediction problems.
- Practice handling and preprocessing real-world data with its inherent noise and inconsistencies.
- Explore the challenges of maintaining and updating machine learning models over time.
- Understand the importance of predictive analytics in business operations and infrastructure planning.

Remember to leverage Amazon Q Developer throughout your development process. It can assist you with algorithm selection, data preprocessing techniques, and help you understand complex concepts in time series forecasting and machine learning. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or alternative approaches as you work through this challenging predictive modeling problem. Good luck, and may your traffic predictor help TechInnovate maintain smooth operations during peak times!
