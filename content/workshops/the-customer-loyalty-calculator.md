# The Customer Loyalty Calculator

## Challenge Background

TechInnovate has decided to implement a customer loyalty program to reward frequent shoppers and encourage repeat business. As a key developer on the team, you've been tasked with designing and implementing the core system that calculates loyalty points based on customers' purchase history and frequency.

## Your Mission

Your mission is to create a robust and flexible loyalty points calculation system. This system will analyze customer purchase data and assign points based on various factors, providing a foundation for TechInnovate's new loyalty program.

## Objectives

1. Design a data structure to represent customer purchase history.
2. Implement a function to calculate loyalty points based on:
   - Total amount spent
   - Frequency of purchases
   - Time since last purchase
3. Create a scoring system that assigns tiers (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold) based on point thresholds.
4. Develop a method to simulate a year's worth of purchase data for testing.

## Amazon Q Developer Hints

- Use Amazon Q Developer to help you design an efficient data structure for storing customer purchase history.
- Ask for assistance in implementing the point calculation algorithm, considering multiple factors.
- Use Amazon Q Developer to generate realistic sample data for testing your system.
- Request help in optimizing your code for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Bonus Challenges

1. Implement a decay factor that reduces points over time for inactive customers.
2. Create a simple recommendation system that suggests products based on a customer's purchase history and loyalty tier.
3. Develop a basic API that allows other parts of TechInnovate's system to query a customer's loyalty status and points.

## Learning Opportunities

- Gain experience in designing complex systems that integrate multiple data points.
- Practice working with date and time calculations in your chosen programming language.
- Learn how to create and work with custom data structures tailored to specific business needs.
- Explore techniques for data simulation and testing of time-based systems.
- Understand the principles behind customer loyalty programs and their implementation in software.

Remember to leverage Amazon Q Developer throughout your development process. It can assist you with everything from initial system design to code implementation and optimization. Don't hesitate to ask for explanations or alternative approaches as you work through this challenge. Happy coding, and may your loyalty calculator bring success to TechInnovate!
