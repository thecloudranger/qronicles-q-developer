You\u0026rsquo;re a new developer at this cutting-edge startup, and you\u0026rsquo;ll use Amazon Q Developer to tackle various coding challenges. Let\u0026rsquo;s begin!\nEnter the Development Arena To start, set up your development environment: Install VS Code if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already. Install the Amazon Q Developer extension in VS Code. Authenticate using your AWS Builder ID. Choose Your TechInnovate Challenge Pre-Reqs: Basic programming knowledge and familiarity with VS Code. Beginner Challenges The Inventory Sorter TechInnovate\u0026rsquo;s inventory system needs an efficient sorting algorithm. Implement a quicksort algorithm to organize the product database. The Customer Loyalty Calculator Design a system to calculate customer loyalty points based on their purchase history and frequency. Intermediate Challenges The Order Fulfillment Optimizer Create an algorithm to optimize the order fulfillment process, minimizing shipping costs while maximizing delivery speed. The Data Deduplicator Develop a solution to identify and remove duplicate customer records from TechInnovate\u0026rsquo;s database without losing important information. Advanced Challenges The Recommendation Engine Build a product recommendation engine using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest items to customers based on their browsing and purchase history. The Traffic Predictor Implement a machine learning model to predict website traffic patterns and help TechInnovate prepare for high-load periods. Start Coding For each challenge: Read the challenge description, high-level tasks, and Amazon Q Developer hints. Use Amazon Q Developer in VS Code to help you write the code. You can use any programming language, but consider trying a new one to expand your skills. Leave comments in your code explaining your thought process and showing prompts used with Amazon Q Developer. Submit Your Challenge Solution (Optional) If you\u0026rsquo;d like to share your solution: Publish your code to a GitHub repository. Create a new issue in this repository with the title \u0026ldquo;Solution for [Challenge Name]\u0026rdquo;. Include a link to your GitHub repo in the issue body. Share any feedback about your experience using Amazon Q Developer. Next Steps: Explore Advanced Features or Create a UI After completing a challenge, try these extensions: Use Amazon Q Developer to refactor your code for better performance or readability. Create a simple web UI for your solution using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with Amazon Q Developer\u0026rsquo;s assistance. Implement unit tests for your code using Amazon Q Developer\u0026rsquo;s suggestions. Have a TechInnovate Challenge Idea? Submit a PR! If you have an idea for a new coding challenge in the TechInnovate scenario: Fork this repository and create a new branch for your challenge. Follow the existing challenge template in the Challenges folder. Include a brief description, difficulty level, and suggested tasks. Provide a sample solution in your preferred language. Submit a pull request with the title \u0026ldquo;New Challenge: [Your Challenge Name]\u0026rdquo;. We\u0026rsquo;ll review your submission and potentially add it to the TechInnovate challenge set! This structure maintains the spirit of the Copilot Adventures while setting it in a realistic startup scenario and focusing on Amazon Q Developer in VS Code. It provides a mix of algorithmic, data structure, and real-world programming challenges that developers might face in a startup environment.
